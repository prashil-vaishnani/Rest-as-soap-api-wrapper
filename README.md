# Rest Api as Soap Api wrapper

To get the json data as soap api response i have use express to
call soap request and with use of strong-soap npm package i am able to
extract soap api response as json as well as xml format.

Then that will use as an end point in fetch in react js and
extract the json data as per our need.
